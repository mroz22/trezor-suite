TODOs:
- check-seed step is probably still useful, but maybe it can be handled directly in Firmware update component
- Welcome screen should be used separately
- Unexpected stated overhaul
- Welcome step: 
    - finish texts for security check, hologram tooltip design
- Firmware step:
    - Tooltip design for changelog
    - Animations for connecting/disconnecting device modals
- Generate seed step:
    - DISALLOWED_IS_NOT_SAME_DEVICE doesn't work
    - User clicks new wallet then quickly hits back button and recovery => few secs later "backup" step pops out
- Backup step:
    - missing proper icons for instructions what user should not do with a seed
    - Skip modals
- Recovery step:
    - Word select/inputs design (T1)
    - Advanced recovery matrix design
- PIN step:
    - PIN matrix redesign
